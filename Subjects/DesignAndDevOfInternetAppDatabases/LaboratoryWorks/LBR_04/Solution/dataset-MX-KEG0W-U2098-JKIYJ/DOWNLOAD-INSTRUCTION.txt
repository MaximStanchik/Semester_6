## Total Average Annual Loss (AAL) per Building &amp; Infrastructure - Lower bound

Values of average annual loss (AAL) including all hazards. 
The AAL provides an estimator of losses that are likely to occur every year due to a specific hazard.


Values of AAL are calculated per country, sector (buildings, power, telecommunications, roads and railways, water and wastewater, oil and gas, ports and airports) and subsector. 
They are available in the Risk Metrics section of this platform:
